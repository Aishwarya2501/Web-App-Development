- It's a MERN stack based project .The main objective is to make use of MERN frameworks in the real world application.
- A social media app created using MongoDB, Express, React, Node (MERN), Heroku, and Postman API.
- GetAlong is one of the social media apps which allows old users to sign in with the existing account.
  If not, it allows the new user to sign up with a new account name and password.
  It allows the users to post the pictures and delete the posts too. 
  The user can follow other users and view posts of their followings.
  The profile page of other users is implemented on the client-side.
  The user can like or dislike their post. The user can also comment on their posts. It also allows the user to add their bio.
  It allows the users to search for other users and can follow or unfollow them. It allows to fetch posts and show them on the home screen.
  The users can log out of the app once it is used by resetting the password. The app has additional features such as adding a profile picture and updating a new one.
  It is allowed for all users without any age limit. So, the user who has created an account can interact with the people by following them.
